# UCL Biosciences Computational Research
Welcome to UCL Biosciences' github, where we store Divsion-related code, training material and other information.

[This repository](https://github.com/UCL-Biosciences/Biosciences-Comp-Support) provides information about computational research support activities in UCL's Division of Biosciences. It is intended as a reference point for internal collaborators and external visitors who want to understand our scope, events, and how to engage with us.

## What is in the Biosciences github?
This GitHub organisation hosts shared computational resources for the division. It brings together:
- **Code for common pipelines** – maintained repositories implementing standard workflows (e.g. proteomics, methylation, image analysis).
- **Training materials** – reproducible tutorials, HPC and data analysis guides, and examples for core bioinformatics methods.
- **Shared utilities** – tools, templates, and environment files for analysis and reporting.
- **Reference documentation** – best practices, coding standards, and contribution guidelines.
- **Key project repositories** – links to active collaborations and their codebases.

We aim to make research computing more **efficient, collaborative, and reproducible** by reducing duplication, promoting shared development, and spreading good practice across teams.

## How do I contribute?
Contributions are welcome from all Biosciences staff and collaborators. Repositories within the organisation follow standard GitHub workflows — create a fork or branch, submit a pull request, and use issues for discussion. We can also discuss the transfer of existing repositories here if they are maintained collaboratively or support shared analysis.

For general requests, questions, or ideas (e.g. training needs, new tools, or pipeline improvements), please open an [issue in the computational support repository](https://github.com/UCL-Biosciences/Biosciences-Comp-Support/issues). This provides a single point for tracking and coordinating work across projects.

All contributions should follow the relevant repository’s README and contribution guidelines.

## Computational Support
The Data Science team helps researchers across UCL Biosciences to plan, run, and maintain computational analyses. We focus on building sustainable and reproducible workflows, improving data management, and supporting skills development. Book a meeting with James Gilbert, Biosciences' Senior Research Data Scientist, [here](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/d23d2d9663fa4276b318d8ae8f40ccbb@ucl.ac.uk/meetingtype/GP1vEk6SdU6fTvgYLBKK8Q2?anonymous&ismsaljsauthenabled&ep=mlink).

We can assist with:
- **Analysis pipelines**: guidance on standardised workflows for proteomics, sequencing, imaging, and other data types.
- **HPC use**: advice on running jobs efficiently, using job arrays, and resource selection.
- **Code and reproducibility**: structuring analysis code, version control, and environment management.
- **Training and mentoring**: workshops and 1:1 sessions on coding, reproducibility and data science best practice.
- **Collaboration setup**: where capacity allows, we can collaborate directly on grant applications, data analysis and writing up results in papers.
- **Networking**: we want to do more to connect people across the Division and across UCL, especially UCL's Centre for Advanced Research Computing. If you would like to meet researchers with similar interests and/or specific computational expertise, please get in touch to see if we can help. 

Contact us early in your project to discuss requirements or explore automation and reproducibility improvements.

### Available Resources
The Biosciences Data Science team supports and/or maintains:
- [Auto-Prot](https://github.com/UCL-Biosciences/Auto-Prot)- a pipeline for **automating the analysis** of mass spec **proteomic data**.
- **Computational Training for Biologists at UCL**. We hope to run this annually. Material from the initial series is available [here](https://github.com/UCL-Biosciences/2025_Biosciences_Computational_Training_Material).
- **Image analysis.** We are working with the [Biosciences Microscopy facility](https://www.uclccmd.co.uk/) to support repeatable and reproducible image analysis using python. Get in touch if you would like support with that.
- We can offer support for **analysing RNA Seq data** with [**nextflow/nf-core**](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/). nf-core/rnaseq is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to analyse RNA sequencing data obtained from organisms with a reference genome and annotation. It takes a samplesheet with FASTQ files or pre-aligned BAM files as input, performs quality control (QC), trimming and (pseudo-)alignment, and produces a gene expression matrix and extensive QC report.
- **General support **for using** ARC HPCs (Myriad and Kathleen)**, including setting up accounts, accessing via ssh, transferring files and submitting jobs.

UCL has a Slack workspace dedicated to discussing computational questions. It's a great place to ask for advice on all thing computational! Let us know if you want to join by [opening an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) in this repo.
